# resh

`resh`, the restricted shell, allows only the execution of previously defined
commands. This allows you to precisely control what commands and arguments a
user is able to execute by setting the default shell to resh.

It is useful for example to limit the monitoring user to a limited set of
predefined commands, in a way similar to NRPE.
